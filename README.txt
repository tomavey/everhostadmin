So here are some items that I think would be useful to review and discuss:

1. Link to our the Marvel UI design mockup.  Click around and see what I was thinking about 8 months ago.  Not married to any of this.

2.  Link to proposed PWA graphics and elements we can use to reduce design time for this first version.  If you find a better one, let me know.
